    <p class="one">Baltimore (/ˈbɔːltɨˌmɔr/, colloquially /ˈbɔl.mɔr/) is the largest city in the U.S. state of Maryland and 
    the 26th largest city in the country. It is located in the central area of the state along the tidal portion of the Patapsco 
    River, an arm of the Chesapeake Bay. The independent city is often referred to as Baltimore City to distinguish it from 
    surrounding Baltimore County. Founded in 1729, Baltimore is the second largest seaport in the Mid-Atlantic United States and 
    is situated closer to Midwestern markets than any other major seaport on the East Coast.[17] Baltimore's Inner Harbor was once 
    the second leading port of entry for immigrants to the United States and a major manufacturing center.[18] After a decline in 
    manufacturing, Baltimore shifted to a service-oriented economy, with the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins University 
    serving as the city's top two employers.

     <p>At 621,342 as of July 1, 2012, the population of Baltimore increased by 1,100 residents over the previous year, ending 
     over six decades of population loss since its peak in 1950. The Baltimore Metropolitan Area has grown steadily to approximately 2.7 million residents in 2010; the 20th largest in the country.[20] Baltimore is also a principal city in the larger Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area of approximately 8.4 million residents.[21]

      With hundreds of identified districts, Baltimore has been dubbed "a city of neighborhoods," and is nicknamed Charm City. 
      The talents of writers Edgar Allan Poe and H.L. Mencken, musician James "Eubie" Blake, and singer Billie Holiday, as well 
      as the city's role in the War of 1812 and Francis Scott Key's writing of "The Star-Spangled Banner" have all contributed to 
      the city's historical importance.[22]

      According to the Brookings Institution, almost a quarter of the jobs in the Baltimore region are science, technology, 
      engineering and math positions. The Baltimore Area is known for health and science, which is in part attributed to the 
      prestigious Johns Hopkins University school system, the University of Maryland-Baltimore, and other smaller schools such as 
      University of Baltimore, University of Maryland-Baltimore County, Loyola University and Notre Dame of Maryland University.[22]</p>

    <h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
    
   
    <p class="three">Baltimore exhibits examples from each period of architecture over more than two centuries, 
    and work from many famous architects such as Benjamin Latrobe, George A. Frederick, John Russell Pope, Mies van 
    der Rohe and I. M. Pei.</p>

    <p>The city is rich in architecturally significant buildings in a variety of styles. The Baltimore Basilica 
    (1806–1821) is a neoclassical design by Benjamin Latrobe, and also the oldest Catholic cathedral in the United States. 
    In 1813 Robert Cary Long, Sr., built for Rembrandt Peale the first substantial structure in the United States designed 
    expressly as a museum. Restored, it is now the Municipal Museum of Baltimore, or popularly the Peale Museum.</p>

     <p>The McKim Free School was founded and endowed by John McKim, although the building was erected by his son Isaac 
     in 1822 after a design by William Howard and William Small. It reflects the popular interest in Greece when the nation 
     was securing its independence, as well as a scholarly interest in recently published drawings of Athenian antiquities.</p>

     <p>   The Phoenix Shot Tower (1828), at 234.25 feet (71.40 m) tall, was the tallest building in the United States 
     until the time of the Civil War. It was constructed without the use of exterior scaffolding. The Sun Iron Building, 
     designed by R.C. Hatfield in 1851, was the city's first iron-front building and was a model for a whole generation of 
     downtown buildings. Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church, built in 1870 in memory of financier George Brown, has stained 
     glass windows by Louis Comfort Tiffany and has been called "one of the most significant buildings in this city, a treasure 
     of art and architecture" by Baltimore Magazine.[46][47] </p>

     <p>The 1845 Greek Revival-style Lloyd Street Synagogue is one of the oldest synagogues in the United States. The Johns 
        Hopkins Hospital, designed by Lt. Col. John S. Billings in 1876, was a considerable achievement for its day in functional 
        arrangement and fireproofing.</p>

  <h2 id="climate">Climate</h2>      
        
  <p>Under the Köppen classification, Baltimore lies within the humid subtropical climate zone (Cfa), with four distinct 
  seasons, and is part of USDA plant hardiness zones 7b and 8a.[79] Summers are hot and very humid, with frequent afternoon 
  thunderstorms. Spring and autumn are warm, with spring being the wettest season in terms of the number of precipitation days. 
  Winters are cool but variable, with sporadic snowfall: January has a daily average of 35.8 °F (2.1 °C),[80] though temperatures 
  reach 50 °F (10 °C) rather often and drop below 20 °F (−7 °C) when Arctic air masses affect the area.[80] The average seasonal 
  snowfall is 20.1 inches (51 cm),[81] but it varies greatly depending on the winter.<p>

   <p>Freezing rain and sleet occurs a few times each winter in the area, as warm air overrides cold air at the low to mid-levels 
   of the atmosphere. When the wind blows from the east, the cold air gets dammed against the mountains to the west and the result 
   is freezing rain or sleet. Summers are hot and humid with a daily average in July of 80.7 °F (27.1 °C),[80] and the combination 
   of heat and humidity leads to rather frequent thunderstorms.</p>

   <p>Due to an urban heat island effect in the city proper and a moderating effect of the Chesapeake Bay, the outlying and 
   inland parts of the Baltimore metro area are usually cooler than the city proper and the coastal towns. Thus, in the northern 
   and western suburbs, winter snowfall is more significant, and some areas average more than 30 inches (76 cm) of snow per year.
   <p>

   <p>Extreme temperatures range from −7 °F (−22 °C) on February 9, 1934, and February 10, 1899,[a] up to 108 °F (42 °C) on 
   July 22, 2011.[83][84] On average, 100 °F (38 °C)+ temperatures occur on 0.9 days annually, 90 °F (32 °C)+ on 37 days, 
   and there are 10 days where the high fails to breach the freezing mark.[80]<p>

   <h2 id="parks">Parks And Recreation</h2>
  
   <p>The City of Baltimore boasts over 4,900 acres of parkland.[136] The Baltimore City Department of Recreation and Parks 
   manages the majority of parks and recreational facilities in the city including Patterson Park, Federal Hill Park, and Druid 
   Hill Park.[137] The city is also home to Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine, a coastal star-shaped fort best 
   known for its role in the War of 1812. In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land, a national land conservation 
   organization, reported that Baltimore had the 21st best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities.[136] </p>

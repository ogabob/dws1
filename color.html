    <h1> Airplane</h1>
    
    <p>An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a powered fixed-wing aircraft that is 
       propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller. Airplanes come in a variety 
       of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, 
       transportation of goods and people, military, and research.</p>
   

   <p> Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled.</p>
    
    <h1>Characteristics</h1>
    
    <h2>Airframe</h2>
    <p>The structural parts of a fixed-wing aircraft are called the airframe. 
       The parts present can vary according to the aircraft's type and purpose. 
       Early types were usually made of wood with fabric wing surfaces, 
       When engines became available for powered flight around a hundred years ago, 
       their mounts were made of metal. Then as speeds increased more and more parts became metal 
       until by the end of WWII all-metal aircraft were common. In modern times, increasing use of 
       composite materials has been made.</p> 
       
   
    <p>Typical structural parts include: </p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>One or more large horizontal wings, often with an airfoil cross-section shape. 
            The wing deflects air downward as the aircraft moves forward, 
            generating lifting force to support it in flight. The wing also provides 
            stability in roll to stop the aircraft from rolling to the left or right 
            in steady flight.
        </li>
       
        <li> A fuselage, a long, thin body, usually with tapered or rounded ends to make its 
             shape aerodynamically smooth. The fuselage joins the other parts of the airframe 
             and usually contains important things such as the pilot, payload and flight systems.
        </li>
        
        <li> A vertical stabilizer or fin is a vertical wing-like surface mounted at the rear of 
             the plane and typically protruding above it. The fin stabilizes the plane's yaw (turn left or right) 
             and mounts the rudder which controls its rotation along that axis.
        </li>
        
        <li> A horizontal stabilizer or tailplane, usually mounted at the tail near the vertical stabilizer. 
             The horizontal stabilizer is used to stabilize the plane's pitch (tilt up or down) and mounts 
             the elevators which provide pitch control.
        </li>
        
        <li> Landing gear, a set of wheels, skids, or floats that support the plane while it is on the surface. 
             On seaplanes the bottom of the fuselage or floats (pontoons) support it while on the water. On some 
             planes the landing gear retracts during flight to reduce drag 
        </li>  
        
        </ul>
        
       
        
        <h2> Wings</h2>
        
        <p> The wings of a fixed-wing aircraft are static planes extending either side of the aircraft. 
            When the aircraft travels forwards, air flows over the wings which are shaped to create lift. 
            This shape is called an airfoil and is shaped like a birds wing. </p>
            
        
        
        <h2> Fuselage</h2>
        
        <p>A fuselage is a long, thin body, usually with tapered or rounded ends to make its shape aerodynamically 
           smooth. The fuselage may contain the flight crew, passengers, cargo or payload, fuel and engines. 
           The pilots of manned aircraft operate them from a cockpit located at the front or top of the fuselage 
           and equipped with controls and usually windows and instruments. A plane may have more than one fuselage, 
           or it may be fitted with booms with the tail located between the booms to allow the extreme rear of the 
           fuselage to be useful for a variety of purposes. </p>
           
        
        
        <p>The classic airfoil section wing is unstable in flight and difficult to control. Flexible-wing types 
           often rely on an anchor line or the weight of a pilot hanging beneath to maintain the correct attitude. 
           Some free-flying types use an adapted airfoil that is stable, or other ingenious mechanisms including, 
           most recently, electronic artificial stability.</p>
           
        
        <p>But in order to achieve trim, stability and control, most fixed-wing types have an empennage comprising 
           a fin and rudder which act horizontally and a tailplane and elevator which act vertically. This is so 
           common that it is known as the conventional layout. Sometimes there may be two or more fins, spaced out 
           along the tailplane. </p>
        
        
        <p>Some types have a horizontal "canard" foreplane ahead of the main wing, instead of behind it. 
           This foreplane may contribute to the lift, the trim, or control of the aircraft, or to several of these.
        </p>
        
        <h2> Control Instruments</h2>
          <p> Airplanes have complex flight control systems. The main controls allow the pilot to direct the aircraft 
              in the air by controlling the attitude (roll, pitch and yaw) and engine thrust.
             On manned aircraft, cockpit instruments provide information to the pilots, including flight data, 
             engine output, navigation, communications and other aircraft systems that may be installed.  </p>
             
      
      
      <h2>Safety</h2>
        <p> When risk is measured by deaths per passenger kilometer, air travel is approximately 10 times safer 
            than travel by bus or rail. However, when using the deaths per journey statistic, air travel is significantly 
            more dangerous than car, rail, or bus travel. Air travel insurance is relatively expensive for this 
            reason- insurers generally use the deaths per journey statistic.[27] There is a significant difference between 
            the safety of airliners and that of smaller private planes, with the per-mile statistic indicating that airliners 
            are 8.3 times safer than smaller planes. </p>
